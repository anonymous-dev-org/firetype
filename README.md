**Typesafe ODM for Firestore** - A lightweight wrapper that adds type safety and schema validation to your Firestore database operations in TypeScript.

Firetype extends the existing Firestore SDK functionality while maintaining all its native features and requiring the original SDK to be installed. It provides a folder-based schema definition system that automatically generates fully type-safe APIs for your Firestore collections and documents.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéØ **Full Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type inference for all Firestore operations with zero runtime overhead
- üìÅ **Folder-Based Schema**: Organize your database structure naturally in directories, including nested collections
- üîÑ **Runtime Validation**: Optional Zod-powered schema validation with detailed error messages
- üõ†Ô∏è **Powerful CLI**: Generate type definitions with flexible configuration options
- ‚ö° **SDK Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with both `firebase-admin` and `firebase/firestore` SDKs
- üîó **Nested Collections**: Full support for subcollections with automatic path generation
- üìä **Collection Groups**: Type-safe collection group queries across all subcollections
- üé® **Zero Config**: Just define your schemas and let Firetype handle the rest

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Firetype extends the Firestore SDK and is not a replacement. You'll still need to install and use either `firebase-admin` or `firebase/firestore` as your primary SDK.

## üì¶ Installation

Install Firetype using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install @anonymous-dev/firetype

# yarn
yarn add @anonymous-dev/firetype

# pnpm
pnpm add @anonymous-dev/firetype

# bun
bun add @anonymous-dev/firetype
```

### Peer Dependencies

Firetype requires one of the following Firestore SDKs (choose based on your environment):

```bash
# For server-side applications (Node.js, Cloud Functions, etc.)
npm install firebase-admin

# For client-side applications (browsers, React Native, etc.)
npm install firebase
```

> üí° **Tip**: Firetype works with both SDKs simultaneously if you need to support both client and server environments.
